Dijkstra Algorithm in Python 
This program is based on find the shortest way between nodes in a graph
In this project we wanna find the shortest way to deliver a package using nodes as our clients.
We also use the graph matrix to determinate those shortest paths

The algorithm exists in many variants. Dijkstra's original algorithm found the shortest path 
between two given nodes, but a more common variant fixes a single node as the "source" node
and finds shortest paths from the source to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.
